Description: # **F**irst-**P**rinciples **E**lectro**c**hemistry
        
        This package generates electrochemical current-potential relationships on the basis of reaction energy information.
        Energies for elementary reaction steps and their associated barriers are converted to currents as a function of applied potential.
        Two approaches are included.
        
        1. Butler-Volmer approximation
            - Energies can be derived from either constant-charge density funcitonal theory with the computational hydrogen electrode (DFT-CHE), or with constant-potential density functional theory (CP-DFT).
            - Either empirical or first-principles charge transfer coefficients can be used, depending on the method chosen (respectively DFT_CHE and CP-DFT).
            - Continuous current-potential relationships are returned, useful for generating first-principles cyclic or linear sweep voltammograms.
        2. Instantaneous currents
            - Energies must be calculated using CP-DFT.
            - Charge transfer coefficients are not relevant to calculations, and a CP-DFT energy must be obtained for each potential of interest.
            - Discrete current-potential relationships are output, useful for comparison to constant-current or constant-potential activity measurements.
